Files:
1. List.java
  -Java file that contains the List ADT. It is implemented as a
   doubly linked list and has built in functions for adding, 
   removing, moving its cursor, and returning values. It has
   been modified since pa1 to hold objects instead of strictly
   ints.

2. ListTest.java
  -Provided file to help with testing List.java. Same as ListClient.java
   from pa1.

3. Matrix.java
  -Matrix ADT. Holds an array of Lists to represent a matrix.
   Supports functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying,
   copying, etc.
   
4. MatrixTest.java
  -Provided file to help with testing Matrix.java. Student-written.
   works similarly to ListTest.java.
   
5. Sparse.java
  -Main file. Takes an input file of array size, and non-zero entries
   for an nxn matrix A and B. Creates two arrays and performs set operations
   on them using methods from Matrix.java.

6. Makefile
  -Used to create Sparse. Simply run "make" to use.

7. README
